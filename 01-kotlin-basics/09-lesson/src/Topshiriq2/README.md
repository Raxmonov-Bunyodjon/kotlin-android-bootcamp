# 🪪 Driver's License Eligibility Checker (Kotlin Console App)

This is a simple Kotlin console application designed to simulate the process of checking eligibility for obtaining a driver's license — but with a fun twist! 😄

It guides the user through a series of questions and uses `Exception` handling to validate input criteria.

---

## 🧠 What It Does

This program asks the user 5 fun (and partially realistic) questions like:

- Are you above 18?
- Do you play football? (fitness check 😅)
- Are you married?
- Is your wedding in 2025?
- Have you passed the theoretical exam?

If the user passes all validations, the system congratulates them. If not, it throws meaningful (and funny) exception messages.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Kotlin
- JVM Console App
- Standard Input with `Scanner`
- Custom `Exception` Handling
