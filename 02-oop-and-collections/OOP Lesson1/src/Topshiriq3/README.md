# 👨‍💼 Worker Filtering System

This Kotlin project is a simple employee management system built with object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. It allows you to store a list of workers and filter them based on their age.

## 🧱 Project Structure

- `Worker.kt` – Defines the data class representing a worker's attributes such as name, age, position, and start year.
- `Company.kt` – Manages the list of workers and provides a method to find employees older than a given age.
- `Main.kt` – Provides CLI interaction to add workers and display filtered results.

## ✅ Features

- Create `Worker` instances with key attributes.
- Store and manage them in a `Company` class.
- Filter and display workers older than user-inputted age.
