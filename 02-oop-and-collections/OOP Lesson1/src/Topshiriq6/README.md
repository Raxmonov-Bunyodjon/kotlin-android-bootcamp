📐 RightTriangle Kotlin Project
This simple Kotlin project demonstrates how to create and use a class representing a right-angled triangle. The program allows the user to create triangles by specifying the lengths of the two legs and calculates key geometric properties.

🚀 What I Learned
Through this project, I learned:

How to define and use Kotlin classes

How to implement custom methods inside a class

How to use Math.sqrt() to calculate the hypotenuse

How to structure a basic CLI application

The use of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Kotlin

🔧 Features
📏 Accepts the lengths of two legs (legA and legB)

📐 Calculates the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem

📦 Calculates the area of the triangle

📊 Calculates the perimeter

📃 Displays all calculated information clearly to the user

🧮 Sample Output
text

Leg A: 3.0
Leg B: 4.0
Hypotenuse: 5.0
Area: 6.0
Perimeter: 12.0
🛠️ Technologies Used
Kotlin

Standard Kotlin Library

IntelliJ IDEA (recommended for Kotlin development)
